## Hello World

My name is Prakash, the author of this blog. I'm a programmer with varied interests:
- Game programming
- Graphics programming
- Algorithms: Performance and Optimization
- Programming languages

Often while solving a problem, I've encountered issues that other programmers might also encounter. The plan for this blog is to discuss these issues, and present my findings that might help other people as well.

If you're curious about my projects, visit **[projects.shader.works](https://projects.shader.works/)**. And if you're curious about my background and experience, visit **[resume.shader.works](https://resume.shader.works/)**.

So, there you have it... enjoy!
